# Development Notes:
- Michelle + Nia can update the photos if they want, they're in img/faculty/. (I just took these off the internet, quality might be bad)
- favicon.ico taken from bioinformaticsdotca.github.io, can update if you'd like
- in the upper right corner, there is twitter/facebook/other sharing links, they are based on the 
index.Rmd HTML metadata ? - not that important, we can care about this later

- figure out good naming convention for files
